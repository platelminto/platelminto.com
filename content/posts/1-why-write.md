This first post might be a bit unpolished, in many senses of the word. I'm trying to avoid "writer's trap" - focusing on all the little things that *aren't actually writing*. Classic procrastination. To be completely honest, writing this post is me avoiding setting up a Mastodon server! Guess I'm already a successful [structured procrastinator](http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/index.php).

# Why write?

What does a 20-something year old have to say that hasn't been said before?

Frankly, nothing.

But it's the same reasoning teenage me used to justify not writing, and I suspect the same reasoning that future, 30 year old me would use. I hope that my 40 year old self will have something worth writing about, but that's a bit of a wait.

Anyways, I've started using Obsidian as a shared knowledge base (ish) with a friend, and it's reminded me how fun writing is. Don't get me wrong, I've always enjoyed it, but never thought to just... write. Write about what I want to do with my life. Write about an article I just read. Write about, I don't know, [Limnic eruptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limnic_eruption). It's \*fun* üèì

It reminds me of something I read a while back: scrolling through Hacker News, reading a book, and staring at TikTok all share one thing: you are *consuming* content. Though they might be different in a thousand different ways, fundamentally, it's hard to point at any one of them and feel like you *did* something.

"But no," I hear myself say - "my Economist articles! Reading about the stock market/inflation/quantitative-easing must be productive!" Though a fantastic excuse to avoid leaving bed in the morning, it's the tenth financial article this month, and my main takeaway remains that 'quantitative' is a bitch to type.

*Producing* is something else entirely. No matter how much code I might read, if I don't write any, I won't improve much. That's not to say I should never appreciate well-written programs, or that getting through all of 'Clean Code' wouldn't make me a 1000x programmer. It's a balance. With writing, it's a balance that's been *heavily* tipped in one direction for too long. So here's me trying to change that!

In summary: I want to write because it is fun, and because I want to get better at it. I believe it'll also help me clarify my thoughts, but that's just a side benefit. Honestly, so is getting better at writing! As long as I'm having fun doing it, everything else is just gravy.

## Writing is fun?

But why do I find writing fun? üôà No idea. Maybe writing in this style allows me to have a conversation with, well, myself, and I'm that much of a narcissist that that's something I want? Maybe.

Seriously though, I don't think I can have a proper conversation all in my head. It gets messy, disorganised, repetitive. A discussion with someone I click with gets me much further. Writing might be a way to enable that same type of thoughtful discussion, while remaining the only participant.

Regardless, let's not think too hard about why fun things are fun. They're... fun!

## Next steps

There's lots I want to write about and do. It might be one of these things:

- Have this blog exist on my website. For now, this post exists as a Markdown file somewhere on my laptop - this should change. Before I move onto automated builds or anything fancy, I just want this post to be online. And maybe not look terrible.
- Though the above might not seem like enough to write about, I think it'll be perfect for practice: I'm not super happy with how this post turned out, mainly from a structure point of view. A short, planned-out piece might teach me something.
- Actually set up that Mastodon server I was talking about!
- I straight up want to copy https://tinyprojects.dev/: create some mini projects, talk about those mini projects, and write random shit here and there. I will need to learn some amount of front-end dev for this, but it's about time I do that anyway, so it works out.
