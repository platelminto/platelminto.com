Now that these posts are beginning to exist outside my hard drive, I find myself struggling to write more. I think I'm paying too much attention to if they're "high quality" or not, forgetting why I'm writing in the first place: it's fun! Apparently, repeating it over and over in my first post [wasn't enough](1-why-write.html). Once I decided I was gonna try and use a [reverse outline](https://explorationsofstyle.com/2011/02/09/reverse-outlines/) for my next post, it was over. 0 motivation. So for now, fuck that, and sorry if it these posts remain a lil all over the place. Better than no place at all.

# Friends

The f-word. Scary.

I was talking to a friend about how she maintains her friendships with people that have moved away, and got this answer:

"Oh, we don't really talk much, but when we meet up it's as if no time has passed. We're just as close!"

I think my friend is going to lose most of her long-distance friends. [^1]

It's not just her, either - I hear this all the time among people my age. The optimism is admirable, but personally, nah. Going through college makes many things seem like universal truths: seeing some friends daily, bumping into others regularly, and the rest you're gonna *eventually* see on campus sometime, right? With little effort, social interactions just kind of happen. All is good. ‚õ≥

Then, all of a sudden, you've talked to your old roommate a grand total of 2 times in the past year. Maybe it's up to 3 the next, and 2 again the year after that. Someone you used to see *daily* has now been a part of your life 7 times in the past 3 years. You're definitely still 'friends', maybe even proper, apostrophe-less friends, but there's no doubt about it: the friendship's future looks bleak. Is that [Gotye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UVNT4wvIGY) playing in the background?

## Who's in my garden

Maybe I'm a pessimist. Good! If I believe friendships to be very fragile then I'll be working extra hard to try and maintain them, which can never be a bad thing. To use a (tortured) analogy, let's think of them as plants, with my overall social life acting as the garden. We have to figure out which plants I want to actively keep, and how to water them effectively.

The list of plants was quick to write, but not exactly easy - which make the cutoff? Some might just happen to be in my garden, but I'm not actively trying to keep them around. Even then, are *they* happy to be in my garden? I feel like I'm back in middle-school asking myself these questions, but luckily, we're just talking vegetation. An imperfect list is better than no list at all.

I then tried grouping them by:

* my favourite plants (MySpace style üöÄ)
* how much attention I currently spend on each - maybe I mostly see them as part of a bigger group of plants, or the plant uhhh lives in another country [^2]
* how easy the plant is to keep.


I deleted all of these.

In the end, I had a list of names, and nothing else. The groupings weren't helpful. I decided that if a plant was on the list, it meant I wanted to keep that plant around, and that's all that really mattered.

Now, plants need water, and to varying degrees - but they all need some. **The garden is cacti-less**.


## How the hell do I water my friends?

Though by no means enough, I'm happy to even just have a list. My friendships are something I want to *actively* think about. And more importantly, I promised myself this post would be a short one, so I'm stopping here.

I mainly wrote this to try and figure out how to maintain my friendships. With that goal in mind, this post is... a failure! But the groundwork has been laid for next time.

Hopefully that happens soon-ish. Plants can wither quick ü™¥


## Next steps

There's lots I want to write about and do. It might be one of these things:

- I'm quitting my job soon. I have thoughts about that.
- I want to go to some conferences! Looking at some, many seem like [complete scams](https://waset.org/advanced-biocatalysis-and-synthetic-biology-conference-in-january-2023-in-london). Others, solely for people sent by their employers. So I'm looking at you, [py.amsterdam](https://py.amsterdam/) and [Svelte London](https://www.meetup.com/svelte/)! And maybe some hardware ones too.
- [This project](https://github.com/platelminto/chatgpt-conversation) has received a comical amount of GitHub stars for something I put together in about an hour. Or maybe GitHub stars just aren't as valuable as I thought. [Long Blockchain Corp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Blockchain_Corp), anyone? Regardless, might be a nice opportunity to put it on this site and learn some web dev.
- And obviously... sort out my plant-watering!
