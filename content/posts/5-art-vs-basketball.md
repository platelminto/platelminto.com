- don't know much about art. recently seen a little. perfect time to frame it through the lense of what i know best - basketball.
- can tickle same part of the brain - appreciation of mastery of a skill. witnessing the development of someone's ability, its changes through time. even the storyline of how they got to where they got. the context surrounding them
- not the same: hyper-commercialization of sports. ...or not? need to know more about art. how could basketball be more similar to how art is. can it? should it?
