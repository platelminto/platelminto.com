- learning frontend (typescript, svelte, sveltekit...?), taking long, want to write more. and put this on a site. so let's write about putting this on a site!
- don't know standard for markdown pages -> blog pages, so for now do it manually:
  - apt package for markdown->html
  - manually added surrounding html:
    - title tag
    - description meta
    - (copy-pasted other \<head> stuff)
    - fix footnotes (with backlinks)
    - obsidian backlinks -> relative links
    - preamble class
    - links open in new tab
    - add to index.html
  - wrote css file
  - "build process": site vps pulls git repo and copies over html/css/.ico files every 20 minutes.
  - wow. already started googling hugo, templating engines, what node.js is, thinking about CI/CD for a build process, rsync, css typography. too much. maybe simplecss. later.
- next steps:
	- will create homepage (since simple) with raw html+css, get back into it. svelte overkill for something like it.
	- 1st svelte project: chatgpt-conversation
      - mention advent of code?
